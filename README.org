See the article [[https://karthinks.com/software/avy-can-do-anything/][Avy Can Do Anything]] which demonstrates the power of
Avy. Most of the code for is from that article.

I still rarely use it but it is really nice to have. I find that
=avy-goto-char-timer= is the only command you need.

The most useful things from it has been yanking lines and words, which
use to be complex mouse operations.
